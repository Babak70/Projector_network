# Projector_network
Data and code for the article "Competing neural networks for the robust control of non-linear systems" currently under review  and available on arXiv (https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.00126).


# Description


# Software-requirements
Python 3.7.3
Tensorflow version 

Matlab engine

# Hardware-requirements
Our costum-scripts have been executed on NVIDIA GTX 1080 Titan GPU. Execution of the code without GPU-backed machinces (CPU only) considerably increases convergence time.
